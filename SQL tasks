Given tables:

★ tasks (id, name, status, project_id)

★ projects (id, name)

Write the queries for:

1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT DISTINCT status 
  FROM tasks 
  ORDER BY status;


2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS named 
  FROM tasks 
  GROUP BY project_id 
  ORDER BY named DESC;
3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT COUNT(*) AS named, projects.name 
  FROM tasks INNER JOIN projects ON project_id = projects.id 
  GROUP BY projects.name 
  ORDER BY projects.name ASC;

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE name like 'N%';
5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.id) 
  FROM projects RIGHT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = project_id 
  WHERE projects.name LIKE '_%б%_' 
  GROUP BY projects.name;
show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without

tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from

the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order

by project_id
